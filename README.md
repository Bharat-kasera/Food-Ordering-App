# HOMELY food order application

A simulation of an Application where you can order and pay for food

# Description

**Details**

Homely is an single page application with a well structured layout, where you view both information  of the web app and order food items by adding them to the cart. 

The application let you see both the name and image of each product then gives you the flexibility to add between one to five 5 items to the cart at once with a single button click. 

There is a Cart button located at the navbar in the header section, this buttons contains a counter in a badge, which counts the number of items in the cart an if there are no items in the cart, it displays 0. For a better user experience on the frontend of the application, the button undergoes a subtle bump whenever an item has being added to the cart.

A click of the cart button opens the cart, the cart systems allows you to view the image, name and quantity of each particular good you have added to cart. It also gives you the flexibility to remove and add to the quantity of any particular item. You can close or open the cart at any given time.

All navbar links are functioning, on clicking them, they scroll you to the respective sections in the page.

**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are  React.js, Css, react-bootstrap, react-scroll, animation on scroll library, sweetalert.js library

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the limitless functionalities and flexibilities it brings to me, examples of the these are : 

- useContext hook which i used this to manage the state of some components in my application which includes the functioning cart system
- Props to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Access to 3rd party libraries that made the app much better like react-scroll and react-bootstrap, 

I then used animation on scroll for the scroll animation and sweetalert for the order validation.

**Challenges**

The challenge i faced while building was using useContext to manage the app wide state, becausei am more familiar with redux and redux toolkit for managing state.

**Features to be added**

This is the version 1.0 of the food order application but i hope to improve the app and make it even better in future versions. The features i will love to add are :

- A checkout form
- Implement a dummy flutterwave payment gateway
- Store user order in firebase
- Making the code more cleaner and readable.
- improve the user experience

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
